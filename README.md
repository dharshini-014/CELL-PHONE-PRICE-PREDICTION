# CELL-PHONE-PRICE-PREDICTION
Developed a machine learning–based price classification system to predict the price range of mobile phones using key technical specifications such as RAM, battery capacity, camera resolution, display size, processor speed, internal memory, and connectivity features (3G, 4G, WiFi, Bluetooth).Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, feature relationships, correlations, and outliers using visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps. Identified RAM, battery power, and display resolution as the most influential features affecting mobile phone pricing.
Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Classifier, using Python and Scikit-learn. Applied feature scaling (StandardScaler) to improve model performance and ensure consistency across training, testing, and prediction phases.Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and validated model stability using k-fold cross-validation. Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, and selected Logistic Regression as the best-performing model due to its high accuracy, interpretability, and reliable generalization.Analyzed feature importance to provide actionable business insights, demonstrating how the model can assist mobile manufacturers in pricing strategy optimization, product planning, and competitive positioning in the smartphone market.
